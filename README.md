Payport the video game!

You are a passport issuing official working in an office. You have to issue passports to a long line of people, making sure their documentation is in order, take their photos, and most importantly make sure they are allowed to have a passport! This is a 2D based game from the point of view of the passport official. The passport office would have a computer, a film camera, and stamps, as well as a lamination machine and a printer. You as the player would have to use these tools to issue new passports to the citizens asking for one. The motivation for this is the fact that Sura and Niko have both immigrated to Canada. We both had to get new passports to freely travel around the world. We plan on using Godot or Construct for the game engine for our project, as they are more simple, and would make development easier.
